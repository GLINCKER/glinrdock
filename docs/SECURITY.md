# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

GLINCKER LLC takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in GlinrDock, please report it responsibly.

### Coordinated Disclosure Process

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or any public channels.

Instead, please email security details to:

**security@glincker.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Regular updates**: Every 5 business days
- **Fix timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, authentication bypass |
| **High** | 1 week | Privilege escalation, information disclosure |
| **Medium** | 2-4 weeks | Limited information disclosure, DoS |
| **Low** | Next release | Minor information leaks, configuration issues |

## Security Best Practices

### Installation Security

**Strong Authentication**:
```bash
# Generate secure admin token
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Network Security**:
```bash
# Bind to localhost only in production
GLINRDOCK_BIND_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8080"

# Use reverse proxy with TLS
# See INSTALL_DOCKER.md for nginx/traefik examples
```

**File Permissions**:
```bash
# Restrict config file access
sudo chmod 600 /etc/glinrdock/config.toml
sudo chown glinrdock:glinrdock /etc/glinrdock/config.toml
```

### Docker Security

**Container Hardening**:
```bash
# Run with read-only filesystem
docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp ...

# Drop capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE ...

# Use non-root user
docker run --user 1000:1000 ...
```

**Docker Socket Security**:
```bash
# Restrict Docker socket access (if needed)
sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Production Deployment

**Reverse Proxy with TLS**:
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Implement proper HTTP security headers

**Network Isolation**:
- Use Docker networks for container isolation
- Implement firewall rules to restrict access
- Consider VPN or private networks for administrative access

**Regular Updates**:
- Subscribe to security announcements
- Apply security patches promptly
- Monitor for new releases

### Authentication and Authorization

**Token Management**:
- Use strong, randomly generated admin tokens
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Never expose tokens in logs or configuration files
- Store tokens securely (environment variables, secrets management)

**Access Control**:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use principle of least privilege
- Regular audit of user permissions

### Monitoring and Logging

**Security Logging**:
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor authentication attempts
- Log administrative actions
- Set up alerting for suspicious activities

**Log Security**:
- Protect log files from unauthorized access
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Consider centralized logging solutions

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
